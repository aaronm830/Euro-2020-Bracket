# Euro-2020-Bracket

I used Python, Pandas, and Tableau to rate the accuracy of 173 individual Euro predictions and create statistical reports that reached 120,000 views on Twitter. The code required to do so is included in these files:

EuroBracketETL: Processes predictions from original Excel file into DataFrame
EuroBracketScoring: Scores individual predictions from DataFrame

JSON files containing actual Euro results data by round are also included. Output files for each stage- my personal Euro predictions (Aaron- Euro 2020 Bracket.xlsx), DataFrame from ETL (BracketResults.csv), and processed standings (Euro 2020 Bracket Standings.csv) as uploaded to https://aaronmoniz.com/projects/euro-2020-bracket-standings/ are also shown.
